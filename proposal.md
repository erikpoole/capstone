# Developer Portal for the Qualtrics App Registry

**Background -**
	The Qualtrics XM platform is introducing an application registry for both internal and external development.  Qualtrics partners and employees will be able to create application plugins with customized functionality and submit them to the Qualtrics platform where they will be retained for future use by both the creator and others.  As of July 2019, the registry can accept submissions generated by a command line interface (CLI) for apps based on an Qualtrics app creation SDK.  Development of these three projects is nearing completion and the first Qualtrics partners are set to begin using the platform by August 2019.

**Project Scope -**
	This completion of this project will provide access to the basic functionality needed for developers to get up and running with Qualtrics' app creation tools via the Developer Portal.  Qualtrics has lots of experience in the development of portals and much of the core framework and GUI elements can be adapted from previous projects.  The portal will need to faciliate every step along the app submission pipeline including: developer registration, downloading the CLI and app templates (and the SDK, by extension) recieving an app, and informing users of their progress through validation.

**Project Milestones -**\
	Create a Developer Portal landing page\
	Register developers and store redentials\
	Partition a Qualtrics sandbox environment for new developers to create and test with\
	Faciliate partners downloading the CLI & app templates\
	Integrate gitlab API docks for the CLI and SDK
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Ideally with version control*\
	Retrieve app status (post-submission) and display milestones during validation\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Will require update SDK to allow unauthorized apps to be pulled*\
	Notify (probably e-mail) creaters when an app either fails or passes validation\
	Integrate with existing Qualtrics Documentation on readme.io\
	Integrate blog functionality through Medium\
	Maintain Qualtrics standards for E2E and unit testing

**Stretch Milestones -**\
	Authorization/Authenication of Users\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Based in part on whether partner registration is complete by the time of capstone completion*\
	Create app skeleton/name/credentials in portal (instead of CLI)


**Tools to be Used -**\
	Visual Studio Code\
	Javascript, HTML, CSS\
	Git (Gitlab)\
