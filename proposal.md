# Graphical User Interface for the Qualtrics App Registry Partner Portal

**Background -**
	The Qualtrics XM platform is introducing an application registry for both internal and external development.  Qualtrics partners and employees will be able to create application plugins with customized functionality and submit them to the Qualtrics platform where they will be retained for future use by both the creator and others.  As of July 2019, the registry can accept submissions generated by a command line interface (CLI) that communicates via a customized SDK intermediary.  Development of these three projects is nearing completion and the first Qualtrics partners are set to begin using the platform by August 2019.

**Project Scope -**
	The first partners to utilize the registry will have to accept a relatively bare-bones interface will little support for documentation and no graphical interface.  As the service is hardened a more inviting front-end for the registry will be expected.  My project will create a graphical interface that will connect registry users to Qualtrics’ backend processes for app submission and registry queries.
